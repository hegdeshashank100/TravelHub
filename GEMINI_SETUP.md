# Gemini AI Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

Your Travelers Hub app now uses Google's Gemini AI as the primary source for discovering tourist places. The AI provides intelligent, contextual responses about attractions, landmarks, and points of interest for any city you search.

## How to Get a Gemini API Key

1. **Visit Google AI Studio**

   - Go to https://aistudio.google.com/
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Get API Key**
   - Click on "Get API key" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create API key in new project" (or use existing project)
   - Copy the generated API key

## Setting Up the API Key in Your App

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended for development)

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. Add flutter_dotenv to your pubspec.yaml:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0
   ```

3. Update the API key in `tourism_api_service.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String _geminiApiKey = String.fromEnvironment('GEMINI_API_KEY');
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Configuration (Quick setup)

1. Open `lib/services/tourism_api_service.dart`
2. Find line 15 with `_geminiApiKey`
3. Replace `'your-gemini-api-key-here'` with your actual API key:
   ```dart
   static const String _geminiApiKey = 'AIza...your-actual-key-here';
   ```

⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit API keys to version control. Use Option 1 for production apps.

## How It Works

### AI-First Approach

1. **Primary Source**: Gemini AI analyzes your search query and provides intelligent tourist place recommendations
2. **Smart Context**: The AI understands natural language queries like "romantic places in Paris" or "family activities in Tokyo"
3. **Structured Data**: Returns consistent JSON with place names, descriptions, coordinates, and ratings
4. **Fallback System**: If Gemini fails, automatically falls back to OpenTripMap and other traditional APIs

### What the AI Provides

- **Intelligent Matching**: Understands context and intent beyond simple keyword matching
- **Rich Descriptions**: Detailed information about each tourist attraction
- **Accurate Coordinates**: Precise GPS coordinates for Google Maps integration
- **Quality Filtering**: Focuses on noteworthy and popular attractions

## Testing Your Setup

1. Make sure you've added your API key
2. Run the app: `flutter run`
3. Search for any city (e.g., "Paris", "Tokyo", "London")
4. You should see AI-powered results with rich descriptions
5. Tap on any result to open it in Google Maps

## API Usage & Limits

- **Free Tier**: 60 requests per minute, 1,500 requests per day
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in request throttling to stay within limits
- **Cost**: Free for development, pay-per-use for high volume

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"API key not found"**

   - Verify your API key is correctly set
   - Check for typos in the key

2. **"403 Forbidden"**

   - API key might be invalid or expired
   - Check if Gemini API is enabled in your Google Cloud project

3. **Empty results**

   - The app automatically falls back to traditional APIs
   - Check your internet connection

4. **Slow responses**
   - AI responses may take 2-3 seconds
   - Results are cached for 2 hours to improve performance

### Debug Mode:

Check the Flutter console for detailed error messages and API response logs.
